## 📦 Installation

You have two options to install BlackCard:

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Release (Recommended for most players)

1. Install [Minecraft Forge for 1.20.1 (version 47.4.13 or newer)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html)
2. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourname/blackcard/releases)
3. Download the latest file named like `blackcard-1.x.x.jar`
4. Place it into your Minecraft `mods` folder:
   - **Windows**: `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\`
   - **macOS**: `～/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/`
   - **Linux**: `～/.minecraft/mods/`
5. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile

> ✅ This is the easiest way — no technical knowledge required.

### Option 2: Build from Source (For developers or custom versions)

If you want to modify the code or build the mod yourself:

1. **Install Java 17**  
   Download and install [Java 17 (JDK)](https://adoptium.net/) if you don’t already have it.

2. **Download the source code**  
   Click the green **"Code"** button on this GitHub page, then choose **"Download ZIP"**, or use Git to clone the repository.

3. **Open the project folder**  
   Extract the ZIP (if used) and open the folder in any file explorer.

4. **Run the build script**  
   - **On Windows**: Double-click the file named `gradlew.bat`  
   - **On macOS / Linux**: Open a terminal in the folder and run `./gradlew build`

5. **Find the built mod file**  
   After the build finishes, go to the `build/libs/` folder inside the project.  
   You’ll see a file like `blackcard-1.x.x.jar`.

6. **Copy it to your `mods` folder** (same path as in Option 1)

7. Launch Minecraft with Forge — your custom build will be loaded!

> 💡 Tip: The first build may take several minutes as it downloads Minecraft and Forge files.
