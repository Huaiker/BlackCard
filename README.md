## Black Card Item Configuration

The Black Card's behavior is controlled by two custom NBT tags:

- `targetItem`: The namespaced ID of the target item (e.g., `"minecraft:diamond"`).
- `targetCount`: The number of items to consume. **Must be an integer between 1 and the target item's max stack size (inclusive).**

> ⚠️ If `targetCount` is less than 1 or exceeds the item's max stack size, the Black Card will not function.
---
> 🔑 **Features**
> - Unique collectible item: the **Black Card**
> - Lightweight, no performance impact
> - Forge 1.20.1 compatible

2. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourname/blackcard/releases)
3. Download the latest file named like `blackcard-1.x.x.jar`
4. Place it into your Minecraft `mods` folder:
   - **Windows**: `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\`

### Option 2: Build from Source (For developers or custom versions)

If you want to modify the code or build the mod yourself:

1. **Install Java 17**  
   Download and install [Java 17 (JDK)](https://adoptium.net/) if you don’t already have it.

2. **Download the source code**  
   Click the green **"Code"** button on this GitHub page, then choose **"Download ZIP"**, or use Git to clone the repository.

3. **Open the project folder**  
   Extract the ZIP (if used) and open the folder in any file explorer.

4. **Run the build script**  
   - **On Windows**: Double-click the file named `gradlew.bat`  
   - **On macOS / Linux**: Open a terminal in the folder and run `./gradlew build`

5. **Find the built mod file**  
   After the build finishes, go to the `build/libs/` folder inside the project.  
   You’ll see a file like `blackcard-1.x.x.jar`.

6. **Copy it to your `mods` folder** (same path as in Option 1)

7. Launch Minecraft with Forge — your custom build will be loaded!
